It helps me track my calorie intake and allows me to be in absolute control of my sugar! Highly recommended for people trying to control there sugar and maintain optimal body weight.Srinath RajamThe pursuit of good healthVerified purchase...is impossible without the ability to control one’s blood glucose levels. As a nutritionist and a cycling and fitness coach, I stress food as 80% impact on health and CGM is an indispensable tool to help every individual figure out foods to eat/ avoid and in the right quantities… We all react differently to the same food so eliminating guesswork is an important aspect to overall metabolic health Keep up the great work UH, your supporting data is amazing.Show more Buy M1Discover a personalized way to eat better and exercise smarter using the real-time glucose biomarker.Scan based experience (NFC required)One-timeSubscription2 Weeks Trial₹7,4991 CGM SensorDelivery on purchase12 Weekssave ₹9,995₹34,9996 CGM SensorsDelivery on purchase24 Weekssave ₹24,989₹64,99912 CGM SensorsDelivery on demand52 Weekssave ₹59,975₹1,34,99926 CGM SensorsDelivery on demandAdd 12 Weeks Plan to cartBuilding for a healthier planet.

For every order you place this month, Ultrahuman plants a tree where it's needed most.Add 12 Weeks Plan to cartFAQDoes my device need to be NFC-enabled to pair the CGM sensor?Yes! It is essential that your phone is NFC enabled. If not, you will not be able to pair the Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM sensor) with your phone.How long does the sensor last? Is it reusable?Each sensor lasts for 14 days. And no, they’re not reusable. Each sensor can be used only once, for a 14-day stint, after which you may replace it with a fresh one.Is there a needle in the sensor? Does a needle stay in my skin?Yes, and no. The Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM sensor) comes with a hollow needle that is used to make a tiny incision in your skin (it doesn’t hurt more than an ant bite!), after which a thread-like filament is safely placed and remains under your skin for the period you have the sensor on.Does it hurt while putting on the sensor?Not more than an ant bite. It's normal to feel some sensation during the first day or so, as you are getting used to the sensor.If you feel pain or discomfort, contact the Ultrahuman team through our in-app chat service. We can help you decide if you need to remove the sensor altogether and re-apply a fresh one.Can I take the sensor off every night?Nope! Once applied, the sensor should not be taken off for the 14-day period unless you experience any pain or discomfort.Can I wear my sensor while bathing, swimming, or surfing?Yes, yes and yes! Your glucose sensor is water-resistant for up to 30 minutes and in depths up to 1 meter (3 feet). So you can shower, swim, and surf while wearing your sensor.Can the sensor hold up against all skin types?Yes, the sensor is compatible with all skin types. The patch used to cover the sensor is water/sweat resistant. So, the sensor stays intact. Therefore it is recommended to have a patch on at all times.Once the sensor is removed, does it bleed? No. The Ultrahuman M1 Glucose Tracking measures your glucose levels through the interstitial fluid. There is generally no bleeding while removing the sensor.Do I get access to the Ultrahuman Premium subscription along with my Ultrahuman M1 Glucose Tracking subscription?Yes.
